## Introduction

Phobias impact millions globally, causing irrational fears that can severely disrupt daily life. Defined by the World Health Organization, phobias lead to overwhelming anxiety and avoidance behaviors. Despite existing treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy, accessibility and engagement issues remain significant barriers.
Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT) offers a promising solution, allowing individuals to confront fears in a safe, controlled environment. This project explores VRT combined with Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensors to monitor users' anxiety during virtual exposure therapy.
Driving phobia is a prevalent concern, even among our group of four, where two members avoid driving due to fear. This phobia complicates daily life and highlights the need for effective interventions. Our goal is to develop a tailored VR environment for driving simulation, integrating GSR monitoring to help users manage and overcome their fear through repeated practice.
